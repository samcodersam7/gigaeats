cd gigaeats

# Run setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh

# Or manual setup
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run docker:dev
```

### Available Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start all services
npm run docker:dev       # Start with Docker
npm run docker:down      # Stop all services

# Testing
npm run test            # Run tests
npm run lint            # Run linting
npm run build           # Build all services

# Database
npm run db:migrate      # Run migrations
npm run db:seed         # Seed database
```
