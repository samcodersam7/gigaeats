Microservices Architecture BreakdownFollowing the recommendation in the GigaEats Technology Stack document (Section 2), the backend will be built using Node.js with the NestJS framework and TypeScript. This choice supports a robust microservices architecture.1.1 Core PrinciplesSingle Responsibility Principle: Each microservice will have a well-defined, bounded context.Independent Deployability: Services can be deployed, scaled, and updated independently.Resilience: Failure in one service should not cascade and bring down the entire system (achieved via patterns like circuit breakers, retries).Technology Diversity (if needed): While NestJS is primary, a specific service could use a different technology if there's a strong justification (though consistency is preferred).Communication: Services will communicate primarily via:Synchronous: RESTful APIs (HTTP/S) for request/response interactions.Asynchronous: Message queues (e.g., AWS SQS or Redis Streams, managed via NestJS microservice transporters) for event-driven communication and decoupling.1.2 Service DefinitionsBased on PRD Core Features (Section 4) and Tech Stack (Section 2):User Management Service (UMS)Responsibilities:User registration (Sales Agents, Vendors, Admins, future End Customers).Profile management (contact details, bank info, KYC for Sales Agents, SSM/Halal certs for Vendors).Authentication: Login, password management (hashing with bcrypt), JWT generation/validation, refresh tokens, MFA (TOTP).Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) -

API Endpoints Structure (RESTful with NestJS)3.1 General PrinciplesResource-Oriented: URLs will represent resources (e.g., /users, /orders).Standard HTTP Methods:GET: Retrieve resources.POST: Create new resources.PUT: Update existing resources (full update).PATCH: Partially update existing resources.DELETE: Remove resources.Versioning: APIs will be versioned (e.g., /v1/users).Stateless: Each request from a client will contain all information needed by the server.JSON for Request/Response: Data will be exchanged in JSON format.Consistent Error Handling: Standard HTTP status codes will be used for errors (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors) with meaningful error messages in the response body.Pagination, Sorting, Filtering: Implemented for GET requests returning lists of resources (e.g., GET /v1/orders?limit=20&offset=0&status=confirmed&sort_by=created_at&order=desc).NestJS Decorators: Utilize @Controller(), @Get(), @Post(), @Body(), @Param(), @Query(), etc., for routing and request handling.DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Use DTOs with class-validator and class-transformer for request payload validation and response shaping.3.2 Example Endpoint Structures (Illustrative)User Management Service (UMS) - Base Path: /v1/usersPOST /auth/register (Sales Agent, Vendor)POST /auth/loginPOST /auth/refresh-tokenPOST /auth/logoutGET /me (Get current authenticated user's profile)PUT /me (Update current user's profile)POST /me/mfa/setupPOST /me/mfa/verifyDELETE /me/mfa/disableGET /admin/users (Admin: List all users with filters)GET /admin/users/{userId} (Admin: Get specific user)PUT /admin/users/{userId}/status (Admin: Activate/deactivate user)POST /admin/vendors/{vendorId}/approve (Admin: Approve vendor)Vendor Management Service (VMS) - Base Path: /v1/vendorsGET / (Public/Sales Agent: List approved vendors with search/filters)GET /{vendorId} (Public/Sales Agent: Get vendor details)GET /{vendorId}/menus (Public/Sales Agent: Get vendor menus)GET /my-vendor/profile (Vendor: Get own profile)PUT /my-vendor/profile (Vendor: Update own profile)POST /my-vendor/menus (Vendor: Create new menu)GET /my-vendor/menus (Vendor: List own menus)PUT /my-vendor/menus/{menuId} (Vendor: Update menu)POST /my-vendor/menus/{menuId}/items (Vendor: Add menu item)PUT /my-vendor/menus/{menuId}/items/{itemId} (Vendor: Update menu item)PATCH /my-vendor/menus/{menuId}/items/{itemId}/availability (Vendor: Update item availability)GET /my-vendor/capacity (Vendor: Get capacity settings)PUT /my-vendor/capacity (Vendor: Update capacity settings)Order Management Service (OMS) - Base Path: /v1/ordersPOST / (Sales Agent: Create new bulk order/quote request)GET / (Sales Agent/Admin: List orders with filters)GET /{orderId} (Sales Agent/Vendor/Admin: Get order details)PUT /{orderId} (Sales Agent: Update draft order)POST /{orderId}/confirm (Sales Agent: Confirm order after client approval)PATCH /vendors/{vendorOrderId}/status (Vendor: Accept/reject/update status of their part of an order)GET /my-orders (Sales Agent/Vendor: List their respective orders)POST /{orderId}/quotations (Sales Agent: Generate quotation for an order)GET /{orderId}/delivery/track (Sales Agent/Vendor: Track delivery status)Payment & Commission Service (PCS) - Base Path: /v1/paymentsPOST /initiate (For an order, called by OMS or frontend)POST /webhook/{gateway} (Webhook endpoint for payment gateways)GET /commissions/my-earnings (Sales Agent: View commission statements)GET /commissions/vendor-statements (Vendor: View commission deductions)POST /payouts/request (Sales Agent/Vendor: Request payout)GET /admin/commissions (Admin: View all commissions)GET /admin/payouts (Admin: View and manage payouts)POST /admin/payouts/{payoutId}/approve (Admin: Approve payout)(Similar endpoint structures for Notification, Integration, and Analytics services.)4. Authentication and Authorization StrategyImplemented primarily within the User Management Service (UMS).4.1 Authentication (AuthN)Technology: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as per tech-stack.md (Section 7).Process:User logs in with credentials (email/password).UMS verifies credentials.If valid, UMS generates:Access Token (JWT): Short-lived (e.g., 15-60 minutes), contains user ID, role, and permissions. Signed with a secret key.Refresh Token: Longer-lived (e.g., 7-30 days), stored securely (e.g., HTTPOnly cookie or secure storage in mobile). Used to obtain new access tokens without re-login.Access token is sent with every API request in the Authorization header (Bearer <token>).An API Gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway) or a middleware in each microservice will validate the access token (check signature, expiry).Password Hashing: bcrypt will be used to hash passwords before storing them.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator) will be supported as an option for enhanced security (PRD Section 6.3). UMS will manage MFA setup and verification.Social Logins (Future): OAuth 2.0 flow can be integrated for social logins if required.4.2 Authorization (AuthZ)Technology: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using NestJS Guards, as per tech-stack.md (Section 7).Process:Roles are defined (e.g., SALES_AGENT, VENDOR_ADMIN, PLATFORM_ADMIN, CUSTOMER).Permissions are associated with roles (e.g., a SALES_AGENT can create orders, a VENDOR_ADMIN can update menus).The validated JWT access token contains the user's role(s).NestJS Guards (@UseGuards(RolesGuard), @Roles('PLATFORM_ADMIN')) will be applied to controllers or specific route handlers in each microservice.The guard checks if the user's role from the JWT has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource/action.If unauthorized, a 403 Forbidden error is returned.Granularity: Permissions can be fine-grained (e.g., CREATE_ORDER, VIEW_OWN_ORDER, VIEW_ALL_ORDERS).5. Integration Approach for Third-Party ServicesThe Integration Service (IS) will act as a facade/adapter for all third-party communications, promoting loose coupling and easier maintenance.5.1 Payment GatewaysSupported Gateways (as per PRD 6.5 & Tech Stack 6): iPay88, Billplz (for FPX), Stripe (for cards), GrabPay, Touch 'n Go eWallet, Boost.Approach:PCS will request IS to initiate a payment for a specific order and gateway.IS will use the respective SDKs or APIs of the chosen payment gateway.Frontend will typically handle the redirect to the gateway's page or display their payment elements.Gateways will notify GigaEats of payment status via webhooks. The IS will have dedicated webhook endpoints for each gateway.IS validates webhook notifications (e.g., signature check) and then informs PCS (e.g., via an internal event or direct API call) about the payment outcome.All sensitive credentials for gateways will be stored securely using AWS Secrets Manager.5.2 Delivery Services (Lalamove)Supported Services (PRD 4.4 & Tech Stack 6): Lalamove API (primary), GrabExpress API (secondary).Approach:When a vendor is ready to dispatch an order, OMS (or VMS if vendor manages own delivery booking) will request IS to book a delivery.IS will call the Lalamove API with order details (pickup/dropoff addresses, item size, etc.).IS will receive booking confirmation, driver details, and tracking information from Lalamove.This information is relayed back to OMS/VMS and can be exposed to Sales Agents/Customers.IS will handle API authentication with Lalamove securely.Webhooks from Lalamove (if available) or polling can be used to get real-time delivery status updates.5.3 Communication Services (SMS/Email)Supported Services (PRD 6.5 & Tech Stack 6): Nexmo/Vonage (SMS), SendGrid/Amazon SES (Email).Approach:Notification Service (NS) will determine the content and recipients of a notification.NS will request IS to send an SMS or email.IS will use the appropriate provider's API (e.g., SendGrid API to send an email) with the message content and recipient details.IS will handle API keys and configurations for these services securely.Status of sent messages (delivered, failed) can be tracked if providers offer webhooks or status APIs.6. Data Caching Strategy (Redis)As per Tech Stack (Section 3), Redis will be used for caching.Cached Data:Vendor Profiles & Menus: Frequently accessed vendor details and their menus (especially for browsing by Sales Agents). Cache invalidation on vendor profile/menu update.Session Data: If using server-side sessions (though JWT is primary, some state might be cached).Real-time Order Status: Key order statuses for quick dashboard views. Updated via events from OMS.Hot Product/Vendor Lists: Pre-computed lists of popular items or frequently ordered-from vendors.API Rate Limiting: Tracking request counts per user/IP.Configuration Data: Frequently accessed system configurations.Cache Invalidation Strategies:Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading): Application checks cache first. If miss, load from DB, then populate cache.Write-Through: Data written to DB and cache simultaneously.Write-Back (Write-Behind): Data written to cache, then asynchronously to DB. (Use with caution for critical data).Time-To-Live (TTL): Set expiry times for cached items.Event-Driven Invalidation: When data changes in the primary DB (e.g., vendor updates menu), an event is published, and a listener invalidates/updates the relevant cache entries. This is crucial for consistency.Implementation:NestJS provides caching modules (@nestjs/cache-manager) that can be configured with Redis.Use descriptive cache keys.Monitor cache hit/miss ratios to optimize caching effectiveness.7. Development Phases (Aligned with PRD)Backend development will proceed in phases mirroring the PRD timeline (Section 12) and Tech Stack (Section 12).7.1 Phase 1: MVP (6-9 Months)Focus: Core functionality to validate the business model.Microservices to Develop (Core Functionality):User Management Service: Basic registration (Agent, Vendor), login, JWT auth, simple RBAC.Vendor Management Service: Vendor profile creation, basic menu management (name, price, description).Order Management Service: Basic order creation by Sales Agent, status updates (pending, confirmed, preparing, delivered), vendor order acceptance/rejection.Payment & Commission Service: Manual/semi-automated commission calculation logic, FPX payment integration (via Integration Service).Integration Service: Basic Lalamove integration, one FPX gateway.Notification Service: Basic email notifications for key events.Database: Core schema for users, vendors, menus, orders.APIs: Essential endpoints for frontend dashboards.Security: Basic JWT, password hashing, input validation.Deployment: Basic setup on AWS ECS Fargate.7.2 Phase 2: Feature Enhancement & Scaling (9-15 Months)Focus: Enriching features, improving automation, and preparing for scale.Microservices Enhancements:UMS: Full KYC, MFA, enhanced RBAC, admin user management.VMS: Advanced menu options (pricing tiers, MOQs, lead times), inventory flags, capacity planning tools, promotional tools.OMS: Quotation management, full order lifecycle tracking, CRM Lite features (customer DB for agents).PCS: Automated commission calculation and payout processes, additional payment gateways (e-wallets, cards), SST handling, dispute resolution stubs.IS: Integration with more payment gateways, enhanced Lalamove features, SMS gateway.ARS: Initial dashboards for agents, vendors, and admins.SS: Implement Elasticsearch for vendor/menu search.NS: In-app notifications, more comprehensive email/SMS templates, multi-language support.Database: Schema enhancements for new features, optimization.APIs: New endpoints for enhanced features, API versioning if needed.Security: Regular security audits, WAF setup.Scalability: Implement auto-scaling, load balancing optimizations.7.3 Phase 3: Expansion & Optimization (15+ Months)Focus: Geographic expansion, new revenue streams, performance optimization, mobile support.Microservices Enhancements:UMS/OMS: Support for Direct End Customer Portal.ARS: Advanced analytics, data warehousing.All Services: Performance tuning, refactoring for maintainability.(Future) AI/ML service for recommendations.Database: Further optimization, potential for read replicas, sharding considerations if massive scale.APIs: Support for mobile applications.Security: Continuous monitoring, advanced threat detection.Scalability: Multi-region deployment considerations.8. Scalability ConsiderationsBased on PRD Section 6.2 and Tech Stack Section 8.Horizontal Scaling:Microservices deployed as Docker containers on AWS ECS Fargate (or EKS if complexity grows) will be scaled horizontally by increasing the number of running tasks/pods.NestJS applications, being typically stateless when JWT is used, are well-suited for this.Load Balancing:AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) will distribute incoming API traffic across available service instances.Auto-Scaling:ECS Service Auto Scaling will be configured based on metrics like CPU/Memory utilization or custom metrics (e.g., queue length for SQS).Stateless Services:Backend services will be designed to be stateless. User session information is managed via JWTs. Any temporary state can be stored in Redis.Asynchronous Processing:AWS SQS (or Redis Streams) will be used for tasks that can be processed asynchronously (e.g., sending notifications, generating reports, complex commission calculations after order completion). This improves API responsiveness.NestJS microservice transporters (e.g., SQS, gRPC, TCP) will facilitate this.Database Scalability:PostgreSQL on RDS:Start with an appropriately sized instance.Utilize Read Replicas to offload read-heavy queries (e.g., for analytics).Monitor performance and scale instance size vertically if needed.Implement connection pooling (e.g., using PgBouncer if necessary, though RDS Proxy is an option).Redis (ElastiCache): Can be clustered for high availability and scalability.Elasticsearch (Amazon OpenSearch): Designed for horizontal scaling.Efficient Code & Queries:Optimize database queries (use TypeORM query builder effectively, analyze query plans).Efficient algorithms and data structures in service logic.CDN (CloudFront): While primarily for frontend assets, API Gateway can be fronted by CloudFront for API caching and DDoS protection.9. Security ImplementationsBased on PRD Section 6.3 and Tech Stack Section 7.Data Encryption:In Transit: HTTPS enforced for all API communication (SSL/TLS termination at ALB or API Gateway).At Rest: AWS RDS encryption for PostgreSQL, ElastiCache encryption for Redis, S3 server-side encryption for stored files (e.g., KYC docs, menu images).Authentication & Authorization: As detailed in Section 4 (JWT, RBAC, MFA).Input Validation:NestJS ValidationPipe with class-validator and class-transformer for all incoming request DTOs to prevent common injection attacks (XSS, NoSQL injection if applicable, etc.) and ensure data integrity.SQL Injection Prevention: TypeORM, by default, uses parameterized queries, which mitigates SQL injection risks.XSS Prevention: While primarily a frontend concern, APIs should return data appropriately encoded. Set Content-Security-Policy headers.HTTP Security Headers: Use helmet.js (NestJS middleware) to set security-related HTTP headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.).Rate Limiting: Implement API rate limiting (e.g., using @nestjs/throttler with Redis) to prevent abuse.Secrets Management: Use AWS Secrets Manager for storing database credentials, API keys, JWT secrets, etc. Inject these as environment variables into containers.Web Application Firewall (WAF): AWS WAF integrated with ALB or API Gateway to protect against common web exploits (SQLi, XSS, etc.).Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing: Schedule periodic external security assessments.Logging & Monitoring:Comprehensive logging of requests, errors, and security events (e.g., failed logins, authorization failures).Use AWS CloudWatch Logs, potentially shipping to an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Datadog for analysis and alerting.PDPA Compliance:Implement mechanisms for data subject access requests (DSARs).Ensure data minimization.Secure handling of personal data.Obtain clear consent where necessary.Least Privilege: Ensure IAM roles for services and users have only the minimum necessary permissions.10. Deployment Strategy (AWS)Based on Tech Stack Sections 4 & 10.Cloud Provider: AWS (Asia Pacific - Singapore region for low latency to Malaysia).Containerization:Each microservice will be packaged as a Docker image.Use multi-stage Docker builds for smaller, more secure production images.Orchestration & Compute:AWS ECS Fargate: Recommended for running containerized microservices without managing underlying EC2 instances. Simplifies operations for a startup.(Alternative for future complexity: AWS EKS - Kubernetes).Infrastructure as Code (IaC):Terraform: To define and manage all AWS infrastructure resources (VPC, subnets, security groups, ECS services, RDS instances, ElastiCache, OpenSearch, S3 buckets, IAM roles, etc.). This ensures reproducible and version-controlled environments.CI/CD Pipeline:Source Control: GitHub.CI/CD Tool: GitHub Actions.Pipeline Steps:Commit/Push: Developer pushes code to a feature branch.Pull Request: PR created to develop or main branch.Automated Build: GitHub Actions triggers:Linting and code style checks.Unit tests (Jest).Integration tests (Supertest against a test database).Security scans (e.g., Snyk, SonarQube if integrated).Build Docker image.Push to Registry: Docker image pushed to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).Deployment (to Staging/Dev): On merge to develop, GitHub Actions triggers Terraform to apply changes or an ECS deployment to update the staging environment.Deployment (to Production): On merge/tag to main, a similar process (potentially with manual approval) deploys to the production environment. Blue/Green or Canary deployment strategies can be adopted for safer rollouts.Database Migrations:TypeORM Migrations: Used to manage database schema changes. Migrations will be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline before deploying a new version of a service that requires schema changes.Configuration Management:Environment-specific configurations (DB URLs, API keys) will be managed via AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, injected into containers as environment variables at runtime.Logging & Monitoring:AWS CloudWatch: For logs, metrics, and basic alarms.(Optional) Centralized logging with ELK/OpenSearch Stack or Datadog.Application Performance Monitoring (APM) with New Relic or Datadog.Error tracking with Sentry.Environments:Development: Local Docker Compose setup (as per Tech Stack Section 10).Staging: A near-production replica on AWS for testing.Production: Live environment on AWS.This backend implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the GigaEats platform, leveraging the chosen technology stack to meet the defined requirements for functionality, scalability, and security. It should be treated as a living document, subject to refinement as development progresses.
