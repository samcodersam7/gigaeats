Scalability: Suitable for building large-scale applications as GigaEats grows.
Styling: Tailwind CSS or a component library like Material-UI (MUI) / Ant Design.
Justification:
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development and customization, ensuring a "Modern & Tech-Forward" feel (Section 8).
Component Libraries (MUI/Ant Design): Offer pre-built, accessible, and themeable components, speeding up development of dashboards and forms, which are core to the Sales Agent and Vendor portals (Sections 4.1, 4.2).
State Management: Redux Toolkit or Zustand.
Justification: For managing complex application state, especially in dashboards with real-time updates (e.g., order tracking, commission tracking - Section 4.1, 4.2). Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux, while Zustand offers a lighter-weight alternative.
2. Backend Languages and Frameworks
Recommendation: Node.js with Express.js / NestJS or Python with Django / FastAPI for the microservices architecture.
Justification (Node.js - Express.js/NestJS):
JavaScript Full-Stack: Using JavaScript/TypeScript across the stack can improve developer productivity and code sharing.
Performance: Node.js is non-blocking and event-driven, making it suitable for I/O-heavy applications like a marketplace with many concurrent users and real-time updates (Section 6.2).
Scalability: Well-suited for microservices (Section 6.1) and scales effectively with cloud platforms.
NPM Ecosystem: Access to a vast number of packages for various functionalities.
NestJS: Provides a more structured, opinionated framework (built with TypeScript) on top of Express.js, good for larger teams and complex applications, enforcing good architectural patterns.
Justification (Python - Django/FastAPI):
Rapid Development: Django's "batteries-included" nature can speed up initial development, especially for admin panels and CRUD operations. FastAPI offers very high performance and is excellent for building APIs.
Data Science & ML Capabilities (Future): Python is strong in data analytics and machine learning, which could be beneficial for future features like "AI-Powered Recommendations" (Section 14).
Mature Ecosystem: Large number of libraries and strong community support.
Language: TypeScript (if using Node.js/NestJS) or Python 3.x.
Justification: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality, maintainability, and reducing runtime errors, crucial for a complex platform.
3. Database Solutions
As outlined in the PRD (Section 6.1):
Primary Relational Database: PostgreSQL
Justification:
Robustness & Reliability: Known for its data integrity, ACID compliance, and ability to handle complex queries.
Scalability: Supports various replication and scaling strategies.
Advanced Features: Rich set of features, including JSONB support (useful for flexible data structures like custom order fields), full-text search capabilities (though dedicated search might be better), and geospatial data types (useful for delivery logistics).
Open Source: No licensing costs.
Caching Solution: Redis
Justification:
Performance: In-memory data store providing extremely fast read/write operations, ideal for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., vendor profiles, popular menu items, session data) to reduce load on the primary database and improve response times (Section 6.2).
Versatility: Can also be used for message brokering (e.g., for inter-service communication in a microservices architecture), real-time counters, and leaderboards.
Search Database: Elasticsearch (or Algolia as a managed service)
Justification:
Advanced Search: Provides powerful full-text search, faceted search, filtering, and relevance scoring, crucial for the "Vendor Catalog & Browsing" feature (Section 4.1) allowing agents to easily find vendors and menus.
Scalability: Designed to scale horizontally.
Analytics: Can also be used for log analytics and monitoring.
Algolia (Alternative): Offers an easier-to-manage SaaS solution if the team prefers not to self-host and manage Elasticsearch, though it comes with its own pricing model.
4. Cloud Infrastructure and Hosting Options
Recommendation: Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Justification (AWS as primary example):
Comprehensive Services: Offers a wide array of managed services that align with GigaEats' needs:
Compute: EC2 (Virtual Machines), ECS/EKS (Containers for microservices - Section 6.1), Lambda (Serverless for specific functions).
Database: RDS for PostgreSQL, ElastiCache for Redis, Amazon Elasticsearch Service (or OpenSearch).
Networking: VPC, Route 53, ELB (Elastic Load Balancing - Section 6.2).
Storage: S3 (for static assets like images, documents - Section 4.2 Menu Management).
DevOps Tools: CodeDeploy, CodePipeline for CI/CD.
Scalability & Reliability: Proven infrastructure for building highly available and scalable applications (Section 6.2).
Global Reach: Important for future expansion, even if initially focused on Malaysia.
Security: Robust security features and compliance certifications.
Deployment Strategy: Containerize microservices using Docker and orchestrate with Kubernetes (EKS on AWS, GKE on GCP) or a simpler container service like AWS ECS / Google Cloud Run for easier management initially. This supports the microservices architecture (Section 6.1) and scalability requirements (Section 6.2).
5. Mobile Development Approach
The PRD (Section 14) mentions "Mobile Applications: Dedicated apps for Sales Agents and Vendors for on-the-go management" as a future consideration (Phase 3).
Recommendation: React Native or Flutter.
Justification:
Cross-Platform Development: Allows for a single codebase to target both iOS and Android, reducing development time and cost compared to native development for each platform.
Code Reusability: If the web frontend is built with React, React Native allows for some code/logic sharing and leverages existing team skills.
Performance: Both frameworks offer near-native performance for most applications.
Large Communities & Ecosystems: Good support and availability of third-party packages.
Hot Reloading: Speeds up development significantly.
Native (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android): Consider if specific native features are paramount or if ultimate performance/platform integration is required, but this typically involves higher costs and longer development times. For dashboard-style apps, cross-platform is often sufficient.
6. API Integration Technologies
The PRD (Section 6.5) highlights the need for integrations with payment gateways and delivery services.
Recommendation:
RESTful APIs with JSON: This is the standard for modern web services and aligns with the "API-Driven" approach (Section 6.1).
Secure API Authentication: Use OAuth 2.0 or API Keys (with proper management and rotation) for third-party integrations.
Payment Gateway Integration:
Utilize the official SDKs provided by Malaysian payment gateways like Billplz, iPay88, Stripe Malaysia for FPX, e-wallets, and card payments. Ensure server-side processing of payments for security.
Delivery Service Integration (Lalamove):
Integrate using Lalamove's official API. Design robust error handling and status tracking mechanisms.
Communication APIs (SMS/Email):
Integrate with services like Twilio/Vonage for SMS (OTPs, notifications) and SendGrid/Mailgun for transactional emails.
API Gateway: Implement an API Gateway (e.g., Amazon API Gateway, Kong) to manage, secure, and monitor APIs, especially in a microservices architecture.
7. Security Implementations
Based on PRD Section 6.3:
Data Encryption:
In Transit: Enforce HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for all communications. Use a service like AWS Certificate Manager.
At Rest: Utilize database-level encryption (e.g., AWS RDS encryption) and encrypt sensitive files stored in S3.
Authentication & Authorization:
Identity Provider: Use services like Auth0, AWS Cognito, or Firebase Authentication for managing user identities, secure password policies, and MFA.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement granular RBAC within each microservice based on user roles (Sales Agent, Vendor, Admin).
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Use for stateless authentication between services and for client sessions.
Input Validation & Sanitization:
Implement robust validation on both frontend and backend (using libraries like Joi, Zod, or built-in framework validation) to prevent XSS, SQL Injection, etc.
Web Application Firewall (WAF): Use AWS WAF or Cloudflare to protect against common web exploits.
Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing: As stated in the PRD, schedule these activities.
PDPA Compliance:
Implement data handling practices aligned with PDPA: clear consent mechanisms, data minimization, secure storage, and processes for data access/deletion requests.
Secrets Management: Use services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing API keys, database credentials, etc.
8. Scalability Considerations
Based on PRD Section 6.2:
Microservices Architecture (Section 6.1): Inherently supports scalability by allowing individual services to be scaled independently based on demand.
Cloud-Native Design:
Load Balancing: Utilize cloud provider load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB/ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple instances of services.
Auto-Scaling: Configure auto-scaling groups for compute resources (EC2 instances, containers) to automatically adjust capacity based on load.
Stateless Services: Design backend services to be stateless where possible, allowing for easier horizontal scaling. Store session state in Redis or a similar distributed cache.
Database Scalability:
Read Replicas: Use read replicas for PostgreSQL to offload read traffic.
Connection Pooling: Implement connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
Sharding (Future): Plan for potential database sharding if data volume grows immensely, though this adds complexity.
Asynchronous Processing: Use message queues (e.g., AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams) for background tasks, notifications, and decoupling services (e.g., order processing, commission calculation) to improve responsiveness and resilience.
Content Delivery Network (CDN): Use a CDN (e.g., Amazon CloudFront, Cloudflare) to cache static assets (images, JS, CSS) closer to users, reducing latency and server load.
Monitoring & Logging: Implement comprehensive monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch) and centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, Datadog) to identify performance bottlenecks and enable proactive scaling.
This technology stack provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for GigaEats. The specific choices within each category can be further refined based on team expertise, budget, and evolving project needs.
